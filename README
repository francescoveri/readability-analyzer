# Readability Analyzer (Shiny)

A Shiny application to **compare readability across multiple PDF documents** (up to 5 at once).  
The app extracts and cleans text from PDFs, computes several standard readability indices, and provides interactive plots, tables, and downloadable results.

  - **Automated Readability Index (ARI)**  
  - **Linsear Write**  
  - **Fry components** (syllables / 100 words, sentences / 100 words)  
  - Optional: **Spache** (original and revised) with a familiar-word list  

- Visual outputs:
