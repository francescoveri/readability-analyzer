# Readability + Credibility Signals Analyzer (Shiny)

Upload **1–5 PDFs** and compare them on classic + extended **readability metrics**, **relationships between metrics**, **readability over the document**, and **credibility-style text signals** (heuristics).

> **Note:** “Credibility signals” here are **style/evidence indicators** (e.g., citations, numbers, hedging), **not fact-checking**. A document can look credible and still be wrong.

## Features

### Readability metrics
Computed per PDF after text extraction + cleaning:
- **Flesch Reading Ease (FRE)** (higher = easier)
- **Flesch–Kincaid Grade (FKG)** (higher = harder)
- **Automated Readability Index (ARI)** (higher = harder)
- **Linsear Write**
- **Fry components** (syllables/100 + sentences/100; includes plot + samples table)
- **Optional Spache** (requires a familiar word list)
- **Gunning Fog**
- **SMOG** (may be `NA` for short texts)
- **Coleman–Liau**
- **LIX / RIX** (often robust for EU-language texts)

### Relationships
- **Correlation heatmap** between readability metrics (needs ≥2 PDFs)
- **PCA plot** (“readability space”) to see how documents cluster (needs ≥2 PDFs)

### Across-document readability
- **Windowed readability**: split text into consecutive word windows (default **400 words**) and compute FRE + FKG per window to show **where** the document becomes harder/easier.

### Credibility-style signals (heuristics)
Per document:
- **Evidence markers**: numbers, URLs, citation-like year patterns, “et al.”
- **Hedges vs boosters**: “may/might/suggests” vs “clearly/obviously/proves/always”
- **Style alarms**: ALL CAPS words, exclamation marks, question marks
- Reported as counts and **per 1,000 words** densities.

### Outputs
- Interactive tables (DT)
- **Downloadable CSV** combining readability + credibility signals across documents.

## Getting started

### 1) Requirements
- R (recent version recommended)
- The following R packages:
  - `shiny`, `pdftools`, `tokenizers`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `DT`, `tibble`, `stringr`, `purrr`, `scales`

Install them once:

```r
install.packages(c(
  "shiny","pdftools","tokenizers","ggplot2","dplyr","tidyr","DT",
  "tibble","stringr","purrr","scales"
))
